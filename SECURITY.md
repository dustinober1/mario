- **Impact**: Potential impact of the vulnerability
- **Suggested fix**: If you have a suggested fix, include it
- **Affected versions**: Which versions are affected
- **Proof of concept**: If possible, include a proof of concept

### 3. What happens next?

1. **Acknowledgment**: You will receive an acknowledgment within 48 hours
2. **Investigation**: Our security team will investigate the report
3. **Fix development**: We will develop a fix if the vulnerability is confirmed
4. **Disclosure**: Once fixed, we will disclose the vulnerability with appropriate credit
5. **Release**: A new version will be released with the security fix

### 4. Timeline

## Responsible Disclosure

We believe in responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities. This means:

1. **Private reporting**: Vulnerabilities are reported privately first
2. **Coordinated disclosure**: Public disclosure happens after fixes are available
3. **Credit given**: Researchers are credited for their findings
4. **No retaliation**: We welcome security research and won't take legal action

## Security Contacts

- **Security Team**: [INSERT_SECURITY_EMAIL]
- **PGP Key**: [INSERT_PGP_KEY_FINGERPRINT]
